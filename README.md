# Simplemap

## Description
A very very simple and stripped down integration of the [Google Maps JS API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/) and Angular.

## Why do we need this?

1. Maybe you don't want to install a new library to your project. You already know how to use the Google Maps JS API and you don't want to learn a new tool to do things you already know how to do.

2. The Google Maps JS API has an extended guide, reference, and samples, which should cover any use case. So, why use a library that wraps these (or some of these and not all)?

3. It's just a small script! :)

_Disclaimer: This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.5.0._
_Thanks: Huge thanks to [kavaliev](https://github.com/kamaliev/google-maps-angular2) because I used a script from their library and for providing me with inspiration_
